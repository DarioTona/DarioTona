I am a **Risk Analyst at the Italian Power Exchange (GME)** and hold a **Master’s degree in Physics** from the **University of Pavia**.

🎓 During my master’s studies, I spent six months at the **Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien)**, where I worked on my **master’s thesis in quantum thermodynamics**.

📊 I have a strong interest in **quantitative research, financial markets, and risk modelling**.  
In this GitHub profile, you will find a collection of **personal projects** developed in my free time, focusing on quantitative modelling, Monte Carlo simulations, machine learning, and time series analysis.

**Please note:** all projects in these repositories were developed outside of my academic thesis and professional role.
